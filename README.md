Urban Tree Health and Infrastructure Analysis
Overview
This project examines how urban infrastructure, such as sidewalk conditions and tree guards, affects street tree health in New York City. Additionally, it explores the relationship between tree species diversity and community stewardship. By utilizing data from the NYC Parks Department's Street Tree Census and the NYC Street Tree Map, we aim to provide actionable insights for improving urban tree management.

Research Questions
What is the correlation between tree health and surrounding urban infrastructure, such as sidewalk damage and the presence of tree guards?
How does tree species diversity correlate with stewardship signs and overall tree health?
Data Preparation
To ensure that the datasets are robust for analysis, we have:

Filtered the data to remove irrelevant entries.
Processed the datasets to address missing values and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
GeoPandas: For geospatial data handling.
